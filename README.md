# Impractical Python Projects (With Tests)

As I want to practice my test writing skills I have decided to impose some restrictions on my following of this book.

- 1 CLI to rule them all.
    - As this book has many individual scripts I thought it would be nice to package them ALL up in a cli interface.
    - This will also give me extra things to test.
- Test for everything
    - Everything needs tests, after all this is the main point of me doing this.
- All in NeoVim.
    - I want to wean myself away from VsCode, so everything needs to be done in NeoVim.

I had previously got to chapter 3, but I am aiming to start the whole thing again.
